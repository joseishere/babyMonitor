My project will be similar to many that I have found across the web in that the raspberry pi will output the video stream to a file which will then be placed on a web server running on the pi available to those on the local network. Where it will differ is that the camera will be made to look like it should be a part of the baby’s room. I hope to achieve this by designing an enclosure that will hopefully look like a normal baby decoration. So far, all of the previous examples of this project only have raspberry pi’s in random enclosures and all look weird and scary. Not like something that should be pointing at your baby all day. 
	Another difference between my project and other projects in the same category, home security, is that my project will be displaying the live feed at all times. The camera in my project will not be triggered by motion. It will always be running. This is because in a home security scenario the only parts that are important to you are when objects move on the screen. When dealing with a baby however parents feel 100 times safer with a video feed on all of the time then only coming on periodically when the baby moves.
	The final difference between my project and others is that I hope to also transmit sound. That way when you have the stream open on your phone or your computer and you are looking away the sound of the baby will draw your attention back to the screen when needed. This also makes my project work like more traditional baby monitors that only transmit sound.
